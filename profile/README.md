# Turbo Native workshop

**Learn how to use the native iOS Turbo wrapper to build high-fidelity hybrid apps with native navigation.**

Hi, I'm [Joe](https://masilotti.com)! ðŸ‘‹ I'm running a Turbo Native workshop in December.

This organization manages the private repositories for the code we will write together. If you are attending a session you will be given access to the code.

If you'd like to attend the _next_ session in early 2023 then [register](https://masilotti.com/turbo-native-workshop/) or [send me an email](mailto:joe@masilotti.com).
